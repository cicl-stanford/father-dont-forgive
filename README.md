#### experiments 

The experiments folder is for the online (or in lab) experiments. Each experiment should be in its own folder. When you run another experiment, make sure to create a new folder (so that we always know what an experiment looked like when it was run). In readme file for the experiments folder, provide a brief summary of each experiment. Also note down any additional information that may not be saved within each experiment (e.g. how much the payment was for MTurk participants).

### data 

contains anonymized data from all experiments. For each experiment:

[...]study_X-responses.csv contains the response data (i.e. responsibilty judgments).

[...]study_X-participants.csv contains demographic information and post-experiment feedback/comments from participants.

### figures 

contains all the figures from the paper (generated using the script in code/R).
